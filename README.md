This is the repository for a Cessna 208B Grand Caravan for X-Plane 12.
The project is in Alpha fase, the aircraft is flyable but allot is not yet done. Updates will be posted on this Github Page. 
The project is GNU GPL v2 Licensed. 

Versions:
The Passenger version with Digital Panel (G1000) without cargopod for 2 Pilots and 8 pax is the first version.
There will be a cargo version with cargo in/exterior, 3d model is already done.
There will be a analog panel for the fans of older instruments.
Maybe if enough people want it I'll also build a floats version.

What works?
The aircraft is flyable, the flightmodel works.
The PFD and MFD of the G1000 are clickble on the screens so you can use them. Not yet animated the buttons.
Light switches work
Pitch Trim wheel works.
Aileron trim knob works but not yet animated
Alternate air, Pitot heat and Stall heat work.
Analog instruments work (except Torque).
Yokes work and animated, Rudder pedals also animated.
Panel is mostly textured, fuselage also, but the UV Map of the fuselage will change.
Yokes can be hidden.

To-do:
Solved with hotfix, have to look in permanent solution. Get the G1000 on the right busses so you don't have to click twice to let X-Plane start.
Let all CBPanel switches work so you don't have to start with Ctrl+Shift+E (or another key if you changed the standard start key of X-plane)
Pedestral animations
All the missing panel animations
CBPanel animations.
Overhead animations
Door animations
Panel on the right side in the footbay is missing.
Texturework for the interior. 
Details on the fuselage are missing and will be added, also a better UV map will be added.
Gear animations, only the wheels are roling at the moment but not yet turning and the strut is also not yet working.
All externel wing animations.
G1000 animations
Blender lightning for the exterior, cabin and flightdeck.
A few instruments and buttons/switches ar missing like the clock, hobbsmeter and Lightning brightness switches.
A menu like the Metroliner for weight and balance, changing liveries and versions without leaving the sim.
Add a Avitab tablet
Look into Skunkcraft updater so you don't have to follow this Github and get automatic updates.
More things.

If you want to help:
I'm not the most experienced flight model developer for Turboprop engines. If somebody wan't to tweak it and get it included, let me know, more than welcome.
If you want to help on another field, let me know.
