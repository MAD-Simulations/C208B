This is the repository for a Cessna 208B Grand Caravan for X-Plane 12.
The project is in Pre release fase, the aircraft is flyable but is not yet done. Updates will be posted on this Github Page. 
The project is GNU GPL v2 Licensed. 

Versions:
The Passenger version with Digital Panel (G1000) without cargopod for 2 Pilots and 8 pax is the first version.
There is also a Passenger version with Cargopod included.
There is a cargo version with cargo in/exterior and cargo in the back.
There will be a analog panel for the fans of older instruments.
Maybe if enough people want it I'll also build a floats version.

What works?
The aircraft is flyable, the flightmodel works.
The PFD and MFD of the G1000 are clickble on the screens so you can use them. Not yet animated the buttons.
Light switches work
Pitch Trim wheel works.
Pedestral trim/throttle levers work
Alternate air, Pitot heat and Stall heat work.
Analog instruments work.
Yokes work and animated, Rudder pedals also animated.
Panel is mostly textured, fuselage also.
Yokes can be hidden.

To-do:

Let all CBPanel switches work so you don't have to start with Ctrl+Shift+E (or another key if you changed the standard start key of X-plane)
All the missing panel animations
CBPanel animations.
Overhead animations
Back door, cargopod door and engine door animations
Texturework for the interior. 
Gear animations, only the wheels are roling and turning at the moment, the strut is also not yet working.
External trim animations animations.
A few instruments and buttons/switches ar missing like the clock, hobbsmeter, ELT and Lightning brightness switches.
A EFB with menu for weight and balance, changing liveries, going to Avitab and select different versions without leaving the sim.
Look into Skunkcraft updater so you don't have to follow this Github and get automatic updates.
More things.

If you want to help let us know, we like working together with talented individuals or other groups.
